# A* Algorithm

This project was made for a college assignment (in French).

The objective of this algorithm is to simulate a robotic arm which take boxes and stack them.

To find the most efficient way to obtain this result, the [A* algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) was used.

### Languages and tools used :
 - Python
 - anytree library
 - linux




## Installation

To run this project you need to have the [anytree](https://pypi.org/project/anytree/) library.

You can run this command to install it :
```
  pip install anytree
```
    
## Deployment

Before running this project, check if you have anytree installed

![pip_list](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62746976/205282343-24f40e0d-c07f-4f35-901d-80432ed7ab72.png)

Then go to the project folder and execute the main file

    python main.py

This will create a **.png** image and a **.dot** file in the folder.

Those files are the result of the algorithm.

## Demo

After the execution, the main file will create two files in the project folder :

You can open tree.png :

This is the final tree generated by the algorithm, the node colored in **red** is the end result.
